# <p align="center">Catalyst</p>

Catalyst is your AI-powered sidekick for tackling legal contracts. It takes
those cryptic, jargon-filled documents and dumbs it down for the mere mortals.
Spare us the legalese, they say. It's like OpenAI, Vercel, and NextJS walked
into a bar and said, "Let's make contracts fun, guys!"

## Archive

Please note that Catalyst is a side project fueled by credits. Once those
credits run dry, we ball. But fret not! The code will remain here, a testament
to the magic that once was. Albeit, part of it shall never go public, because
where's the fun in that.
